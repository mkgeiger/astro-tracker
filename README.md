# High precision Astro Tracker with wireless GOTO

## Overview

The inspiration of this project founded in the combination of my two hobbies: astronomy and microcontroller projects. This projects describes building an equatorial mount stepper motor controller with GPS high precision star-, moon- and sun-tracking. A wireless GOTO control via Skysafari App and a webinterface for individual stepper motor settings is also implemented. The features for my needs are:
